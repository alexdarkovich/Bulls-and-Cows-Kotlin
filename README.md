My solutions for the Jetbrain's Academy project 'Bulls and Cows'.

The task is to recreate the original version of the game and then to improve it.
The solution is build up step by step over several stages.
Stage 1: Start by simulating the gameplay to get familiar with the process.
Stage 2: Implement the grading mechanism.
Stage 3: Create a simple random number generator.
Stage 4: Make a fully functional classic version of the game.
Stage 5: Rewrite the random number generator using the built-in tools.
Stage 6: Make the game more difficult by improving the code generator.
Stage 7: Make your application more stable by handling various errors.
